    <p>India (officially the Republic of India (Bhārat Gaṇarājya), is a country in South Asia. It is the seventh-largest country by area, the second-most populous country with over 1.2 billion people, and the most populous democracy in the world. Bounded by the Indian Ocean on the south, the Arabian Sea on the south-west, and the Bay of Bengal on the south-east, it shares land borders with Pakistan to the west; China, Nepal, and Bhutan to the north-east; and Burma and Bangladesh to the east. In the Indian Ocean, India is in the vicinity of Sri Lanka and the Maldives; in addition, Ind ia's Andaman and Nicobar Islands share a maritime border with Thailand and Indonesia.</p>
    <p>The Indian economy is the world's tenth-largest by nominal GDP and third-largest by purchasing power parity (PPP). Following market-based economic reforms in 1991, India became one of the fastest-growing major economies; it is considered a newly industrialised country. However, it continues to face the challenges of poverty, corruption, malnutrition, inadequate public healthcare, and terrorism. A nuclear weapons state and a regional power, it has the third-largest standing army in the world and ranks ninth in military expenditure among nations. India is a federal constitutional republic governed under a parliamentary system consisting of 29 states and 7 union territories. India is a pluralistic, multilingual, and a multi-ethnic society. It is also home to a diversity of wildlife in a variety of protected habitats.</p>

    <p>India covers 3,287,263 sq km, which extends from the Himalayas, the world's highest mountains, to the southern tropical rain forests.  It is the seventh largest country in the world and the mountains and sea that surround India separate it from other parts of Asia.   In the shape of a triangle, India's topography is greatly varied in that there although there are deserts and rain forests, much of it's land is comprised of fertile river plains and high plateaus.  Some of the main rivers that flow through India are the Ganges, Brahmaputra and the Indus.  These rivers start in the high mountains and carry down rich alluvial soil to the plains below, thus creating the fertile river plains.</p>
    <p>Four distinct regions can be found in India - mountains, plains, the desert and the southern peninsula.  The mountainous region is comprised of the Himalayas, a mountain range that has some of the highest peaks in the world.  They have rivers that increase and decrease in amount  with the snowfall. During the monsoon season, the heavy water coming out of them causes frequent flooding.  On one side of India, the heights make them impassable, whereas in the east the ranges are considerably lower.  The plains are made up of basins by three main rivers in India - the Indus, the Ganga and the Brahmaputra.  Flat alluvium (rich soil deposited by rivers) is abundant and this area is considered to be one of the largest areas of it in the world.  In addition to that international distinction, this area is also considered to be one of the most heavily populated areas in the world.  The desert areas in India are split by land that is rocky and comprised of limestone ridges.  The last region, the peninsula, has mountains surrounding it, with coastal areas on the other side of the mountains.<p>
